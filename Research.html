            <p>Los Tuxtlas is a region in Veracruz, Mexico touted as the northern edge of neotropical rainforests. 
                Like other tropical forests, deforestation has been a significant issue here and is driven by the demand for cattle pasture.
                The Los Tuxtlas Restoration experiment was established in 2006 by Drs. Henry F. Howe and Cristina Martínez-Garza to investigate
                how restoration design and initial species composition influenced restoration success. 
                The experiment is composed of 24 (30 x 30m) fenced plots separated by 35 m of actively grazed pasture on a hillside gradient.
                Plots belong to three treatments: (i) plots planted with animal-dispersed trees, (ii) plots planted with wind-dispersed trees, 
                and (iii) unplanted plots to simulate natural succession. <br><br>
                The main hypothesis is that plantings with animal-dispersed species will attract more dispersal agents, enhancing seed rain, eventually seedling establishment, ultimately accelerating ecological succession.

                Seed dispersal into fragmented tropical landscapes limits the rate and character of 
                ecological succession between forest remnants. In a novel experiment in recovery 
                of dispersal between forest remnants, 120 1-m² seed traps were placed in fenced 
                plots in active pasture 90–250 m from forest, and in nearby primary and secondary 
                forests. Total seed rain from December 2006 to January 2008 included 69,135 seeds 
                of 57 woody species. High richness of seed rain of early-successional trees occurred 
                in all habitats, but seed rain of late-successional woody plants was much lower into 
                pastures and secondary forest than into old-growth forest. Non-metric ordination 
                analysis further demonstrated high movement of late-successional species within 
                and between forest and secondary forest, but little movement of species of either 
                forest type to pastures. Most species were dispersed by animals, but most seeds 
                were dispersed by wind. A pattern of seed rain biased strongly towards wind-dispersed 
                species creates a template for regeneration quite unlike that in nearby forest.

                soil depth on recruits through June 2008. Seed fall and recruitment were not

                year). Thirty years of cattle ranching activities decreased the litter N and P pools 
                by a factor of 72 in the former and 31 in the latter, largely reflecting differences 
                in litter mass between pasture and mature forest. Pasture soils consistently had lower 
                pools of organic C and total N and ammonium (NH4+) than forest soils. However, landuse 
                did not affect the pool of soil nitrate (NO3-), and total and extractable P. Exclusion 
                of grazing and exclusion of grazing plus planted tree seedlings increased N and P pools

                N and P. The main response to restoration practices was a decrease of NO3- and 
                extractable P pool in soils. Overall, we observed that, subsequent to these practices, 
                there were significant changes in the recovery of nutrient pools reaching levels similar

                accelerate natural succession in pastures. We evaluate the growth and survival of 24 
                tree species used for forest restoration in pastures in the wet tropics in Mexico for 
                42 months. We relate their performance to 13 underlying functional traits that are 
                important for leaf display, tree architecture and reproduction. Pioneers realized 
                both faster growth rates and higher survival than non-pioneer species. No consistent 
                ontogenetic cross-overs in species growth and survival were found during 42 months, 
                which implies that species performance early after planting (12 months) predicted 
                performance well after 42 months, probably because environmental conditions changed 
                little over time in these early-successional pastures. Nine out of 12 functional 
                traits were good predictors of growth rates and/or survival measures across all 24 
                species or for pioneer or non-pioneer species separately. Growth rates and survival 
                were positively related to crown size and negatively to seed mass, but they were – 
                surprisingly – not related to the leaf traits we measured. Multivariate plant trait 
                axes explained species growth rates and survival better than individual traits only 
                for the non-pioneer species group. Selection of additional traits may be needed for 
                better predictions of overall performance of restoration plantings. Combining the 
                basic science of functional ecology with the applied goals of forest management and 
                restoration allow us to select the best mid-term performing tree species for planting 
                in pastures using a short-term screening of growth and survival rates. Pioneers and 
                non-pioneer species with small seeds and large crown length are good candidates for 
                plantings in pastures since they have the best mid-term performance.">

                succession on degraded agricultural land by offering insight into factors that 
                influence rates of succession and the composition of resulting communities. A novel 
                study in restoration of degraded tropical agricultural land in coexistence with 
                cattle ranching activities was established in southern Veracruz, Mexico. The 
                experimental planting of 16 mixed‐species stands of 18 pioneer and late‐successional 
                tree species was established from September to November 2006 on an eroded hillside 
                pasture with an elevational gradient from 182 to 260 m and heterogeneous soil depths. 
                An unusually severe dry season in 2007 killed 72 per cent of the seedlings: least 
                squares regression suggested that survival of six pioneer and 12 late‐successional 
                species was mainly explained by initial basal diameter at planting followed by soil 
                depth for pioneers and by elevational position on the hillside for late‐successional 
                species. Individuals with larger initial size at planting (>4mm basal diameter), 
                regardless of germination size in a growing house, survived better probably because 
                larger seedlings developed deeper roots that found fissures in substrate underlying 
                thin soils. Interestingly, seedlings small at planting (< 4 mm basal diameter) 
                survived as well as large seedlings in deeper (>19 cm) soils, but virtually all small 
                seedlings died on thin soils (<18·5 cm). Mortality in restoration plantings can be 
                reduced by planting large seedlings of a mix of pioneer and late‐successional species, 
                recognizing that soil depth is a key criterion for survival of the smallest seedlings 
                in a cohort.

                samples were Asteraceae, Malvaceae, Solanaceae, and Rubiaceae. More abundant families were  
                Urticaceae, Asteraceae, Malvaceae, and Moraceae. The most abundant species in the seed rain was  
                <em>Cecropia obtusifolia</em> (Urticaceae). The greatest seed richness and density was represented by pioneer tree species  
                with biotic dispersion. Restoration plots of trees dispersed by animals had the greater seed richness  
                and density. Restoration plots techniques that exclude livestock and enrich plots with native trees  
                using various dispersal vectors accelerates arrival of seeds for the successional processes to occur.

                Fragmented landscapes reduce animal abundance and movement, limiting seed dispersal between distant  
                forest remnants. In 2006, experimental plantings were established in pasture to determine whether  
                plantings enhance seed dispersal and, ultimately, seedling recruitment. We examined patterns of  
                naturally recruited seedlings of <em>Ocotea uxpanapana</em>, a large-seeded bird-dispersed tree endemic to southern  
                Mexico that occurs in the surrounding landscape. We used GIS and least-cost path analysis to ask:  
                (1) Do restoration efforts alter recruitment patterns? (2) What is the importance of canopy cover  
                and likely dispersal pathways to establishment? Patterns of seedling establishment indicated that  
                dispersal agents crossed open pastures to wooded plots. Recruitment was greatest under woody  
                canopies. Also, by reducing movement cost or risk for seed dispersers, wooded canopies increased  
                influx of large, animal-dispersed seeds, thereby restoring a degree of functional connectivity to  
                the landscape. Together, canopy openness and path distance from potential parent trees in the  
                surrounding landscape explained 73% of the variance in <em>O. uxpanapana</em> seedling distribution. Preliminary  
                results suggest that strategic fenced plantings in pastures increase dispersal and establishment of  
                large-seeded trees, thereby accelerating forest succession in restorations and contributing to  
                greater connectivity among forest fragments.

                and are now being applied to assessments of habitat restoration. A critical question
                for the restoration of tropical forests is how plantings influence the recruitment of
                new species, and specifically the phylogenetic and functional diversity of restored
                habitats.
                We examined 8 years (2006–2014) of tropical-forest recruitment in two restoration
                planting compositions (12 animal-dispersed and 12 wind-dispersed tree species),
                with a control (no planting) in 24 plots in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Specifically, we
                assessed the influence of plantings on newly arriving individuals’ phylogenetic,
                functional, taxonomic diversity, abundance and the change of these measures
                during early succession.
                The recruiting individuals’ phylogenetic, functional, taxonomic diversity and
                abundance increased through succession. Both animal-dispersed planting and
                wind-dispersed planting appeared to accelerate forest succession more than
                controls (natural succession), and diversity in the animal-dispersed plantings was
                marginally higher after 8 years. We did not find any difference in recruiting
                individuals’ phylogenetic and functional dispersion (measured as standardized
                effect sizes) in any given year, or when measured as turnover between successive
                pairs of years, measuring planting composition and control plots.
                Recruiting individuals were phylogenetically clustered during early forest restoration
                regardless of treatment. At the same time, the recruits transitioned from appearing
                randomly constructed to clustering according to functional traits, which suggests an
                increase in recruits’ functional similarity during early succession.
                Synthesis and applications. Both the animal and wind-dispersed plantings
                accelerated the increase of recruiting individuals’ phylogenetic, functional,
                taxonomic diversity and abundance during early succession. However, planting
                treatment did not appear to alter community assembly mechanisms of recruiting
                individuals. Our findings support restoration planting by showing that planting trees
                with animal dispersal syndrome could accelerate forest restoration more than
                unassisted forest regeneration. Furthermore, communities appeared to be
                phylogenetically and functionally clustered during early succession regardless of
                initial planted composition. Thus, while overall diversity increased with planting, if a
                restoration goal is to maximize phylogenetic or functional dispersion, the planting
                composition tested did not provide means to achieve this goal, at least during early
                succession.">

                foragers, rodents could shape tree communities, moderating biodiversity in regenerating
                tropical landscapes. We utilized a fully crossed two-way factorial design to examine the
                effect that grasses, rodents, and their interaction had on tree seedling establishment in
                pasture habitat. We followed two separate tree cohorts for 1 year each within the
                experimental framework. Multiple cohorts were used to better represent successional
                tree species variation and responses. Trees species were characterized by a gradient of
                seed masses and as pioneer or persistent successional type. Both cohort seedlings were
                altered when rodents were present compared to control treatments. In Cohort 1, rodents
                adversely affected seedlings of persistent tree species only in the absence of grass. In
                Cohort 2, seedlings of persistent tree species were decimated by rodents in the absence
                or presence of grass. In both cohorts, seedlings of persistent species established better in
                grass treatments, while seedlings of pioneer tree species were strongly suppressed. Tree
                species seed mass positively correlated with seedling establishment across all treatments
                except no grass–rodent treatments. Strong suppression of tree seedlings by rodents
                (Sigmodon toltecus) is a novel result in tropical land recently released from agriculture.
                One implication is that selective foraging by rodents on large-seeded persistent tree
                species may be facilitated by the removal of grass. Another implication is that temporary
                rodent control in pastures may permit higher establishment of deep-forest persistent

                ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage and acting as stepping stones for the movement of animals through the landscape.
                Here, we evaluated two mixtures of planted and, unplanted areas to figure out which restoration treatment was more 
                successful in skipping the early stages of succession. For this, we measured forest structure of large trees in restoration
                settings after 10 years in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. In 2006, cattle grazing was excluded from 24 plots (30 x 30 m). 
                Eight of those plots were planted with 12 wind-dispersed species, eight plots were planted with 12 animal-dispersed species
                (a total of 2,304 planted trees), and eight plots were left to undergo natural succession without plantings. 
                Planted and naturally recruited trees have been assessed periodically since 2007. A total of 835 planted and naturally 
                recruited trees of 45 species reached large size. Including all trees (planted and recruited), the richness and abundance of
                late-successional trees was higher in plantings than under natural succession while richness of large recruits of 
                late-successional species was as higher in plantings as in natural succession. Also, including all trees, plantings of

                while species and trees dispersed by birds were present equally at all treatments. Richness and abundance of bat-dispersed 
                recruits were similar in plantings and natural succession while plantings of wind-dispersed species had higher bird-dispersed
                 recruits. Composition heterogeneity, driven by natural recruitment, was largest for early-successional trees in natural 
                 succession. After 10 years, the frrst stages of succession (20-30 years) were skipped in plantings: plantings have higher 
                 abundance of large seeded late-successional species. For an overall increase in composition heterogeneity in permanent 
                 agricultural landscapes, we suggest establishing areas to undergo natural succession along with plantings that include a 
                 higher percentage of late-successional species with large seeds.">

                restoration is a conservation strategy to accelerate the process of natural succession and

                to evaluate the effect of restoration treatments on the availability of resources for birds and
                bats. This study was carried out in the Los Tuxtlas región, Veracruz México. In 24 plots of
                30x30m, two combinations of restoration plantings were established in 16 plots: in eight
                plots, 12 species of trees dispersed by animals were planted, in another eight plots, 12
                species dispersed by wind were planted and the last eight remaining plots are under natural
                succession. In these sites, the availability of resources for phytophagous was evaluated
                through censuses and bibliographic information of trees> 30cm in diameter at breast height
                (DBH). These potentially reproductive trees are listed as dispersed by wind, birds, bats, or
                both (birds and bats). At these same sites, mist nets were placed in the central corridor of
                the plots for the sampling of birds and bats. The mist nets were opened before dark to
                capture bats and before dawn to capture birds. The results revealed that the plots with tree
                plantations dispersed by animals or wind provide important resources they generate for
                birds and bats. The abundance of fruit bats is greater in tree planting dispersed by animals.
                The richness and abundance of birds was greater in the natural succession especially due to
                insectivores birds. Restoration treatments were important both for their contribution in

                Treatments included eight fenced plantings with animal-dispersed species, eight plantings with wind- dispersed species, 
                eight unplanted plots to favor natural succession, and eight plots in the primary forest as reference sites. We predicted 
                that by attracting more seed dispersers, animal-dispersed plantings would most closely resemble the primary forest. 
                A census of trees taller than 2 m showed that while wind-dispersed plantings had more recruits, the animal-dispersed 
                plantings most closely resembled the primary forest in pioneer abundance, species density and abundance of biotically 
                dispersed and abiotically dispersed plants, individual tree basal area (in square meters per hectare), and vertical 
                structure. The wind-dispersed plantings more closely approximated the forest in non-pioneer abundance and community

                 the primary forest in total plot basal area. Higher abundance of trees in wind-plantings is explained by lower 
                 establishment limitations, seed legacy effects, and rapid reproduction of a few planted species. As the experiment 
                 continues, we expect treatment effects on seed dispersers will more strongly influence the recruiting plant community,

                Our objective was to determine with camera trapping, which species of medium or large terrestrial mammals (≥1 kg in weight), and with 
                what frequency, visited the plots 12 years after the establishment of the experiment. <br><b>Methods:</b> Camera traps were used in 18 of the 24 
                plots. Two censuses were carried out, one in the rainy season of 2018 and the other in the dry season of 2019. The number of species 
                and the independent photographic records of each one were determined for each treatment (plots excluded from cattle: a) with no 
                addition of plants -natural succession-; with tree plantations, b) dispersed by wind, and c) dispersed by animals) and each sampling 
                season. <b>Key results:</b> The total sampling effort was 290 camera trap days. For the rainy season, 12 photographs and four videos of 
                opossum (<em>Didelphis</em> spp.), nine-banded armadillo (<em>Dasypus novemcinctus</em>) and Mexican agouti (<em>Dasyprocta mexicana</em>) were obtained. 
                For the dry season, the armadillo was recorded in 10 photographs and five videos. There were few records of medium-sized mammals, 
                compared to photo trapping in conserved forest in the area and only in seven of the 18 sampled plots. Overall, there were more records 
                in plantations than in natural succession, and this was more evident in the rainy season.

                Microlophus are commonly found in the dry lowland zones of Galapagos, often close to the coast, basking on lava rocks, or 
                hidden amongst bush and cacti. The diet of <em>Microlophus</em> lizards consists mainly of small arthropods and plant material. 
                On 7 November 2015, at 0950 h, we observed an adult female <em>M. delanonis</em> preying on a juvenile of the same species on Española
                Island, Ecuador (1.4093°S, 89.6294°W; WGS 84; 15 m elev.). The lizard had swallowed its prey tail first, 
                until the beginning of the forelimbs, before it was spotted over a lava rock. Upon encounter, both lizards remained 
                motionless for ca. 1 min before the adult slipped away to the bushes out of sight. 
                We did not find a previous record of cannibalism of this species, though diet sampling of a related species,
                M. pacificus on Pinta Island, did return conspecific tissues. 
                Together, these findings suggest that cannibalism in Microlophus lizards may be more than a rare occurrence, 
                deserving of further investigation. This publication is contribution number 2279 of the Charles Darwin Foundation

                In response, tropical countries such as Colombia have committed to restoring degraded lands and reconnecting forest 
                fragments. To contribute to this mission, we evaluated how easy-to-measure seed functional traits predicted germination 
                requirements and early seedling growth rates (RGRs) for 11 tree species native to the Andean-Amazon piedmont region. 
                Pre-sowing treatments followed a 3 × 3 factorial design: three light conditions (full, partial, and no light) and three 
                pre-germination treatments (hot water, abrasion, and control). A cluster analysis grouped species into three groups driven 
                chiefly by highly correlated variables of seed size and mass. However, species within and among functional groups differed 
                in their response to pre-germination treatments. One exception includes the small-seeded species group responding with 
                little-to-no germination to the absence of light. Since functional traits were highly correlated, we used Principal 
                Component Regression (PCR) to predict germination metrics (germination percentage, velocity, and vigor) and RGRs. 
                The multivariate trait axis of seed size and seed mass measurements (PC1) correlated negatively with germination metrics 
                and positively with RGRs. Our results highlight the challenges associated with using easy-to-measure functional traits to 
                deduce the most effective pre-sowing treatment. Other more relevant functional traits can be measured in lab, but a 
                shotgun approach to testing pre-germination treatments may be more cost-effective. 
                High germination in small-sized seed species highlights the early-successional niche these species occupy,

                <tr data-abstract="Neotropical landscapes are often characterized as mosaics of actively grazed pastures and forest fragments 
                at various stages of succession. Restoring abandoned pastures requires intervening with actions informed by local ecological succession. 
                Here we evaluate how litter production, a key component of nutrient cycling in forests, varies between physiographic landscapes 
                (hill and lowland mountain), among stand age groups (early-secondary: 0–20 year, intermediate-secondary: 20–40 year, and old-growth forests: 
                > 40 year), and in response to climatic (precipitation and irradiation) and forest structure and biodiversity variables (stand density, basal area, species density, diversity), 
                in a tropical humid forest chronosequence. Total and leaf litter production was higher in the lower elevation hill landscape.
                Leaf litter production increased with stand age in both landscapes but only correlated positively with forest structure and biodiversity in the hill landscape. 
                Lack of correlation in the mountain landscape is attributed to greater variance in structure and species composition in the subset of plots selected from this landscape for this study. 
                Both landscapes exhibited an asynchronous, bimodal regime of leaf fall in response to precipitation. Leaf litter peaks prior to the wet season likely occur in response to water stress, 
                while peaks after the wet season that coincided with increasing solar irradiation are likely the result of a leaf turnover strategy to optimize photosynthesis. 
                Ecological succession in these landscapes does not appear limited in leaf litter production, but further research on the drivers of leaf litter production recovery is 
                necessary to adequately guide intervention efforts.">
