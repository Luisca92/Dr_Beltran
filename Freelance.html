          <h3>Scientific Writing Workshop</h3>
          <p> I am excited to announce that I am currently offering a Scientific Writing Workshop for student and research groups in Colombia and internationally! 
            This workshop covers essential topics such as preparing mentally for productive writing sessions, understanding the main components of various writing sections, and navigating journal operations and correspondence. 
            Past clients include the Humboldt Institute and Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. The workshop spans 16 hours and can be delivered in-person or virtually, in both Spanish and English. 
            If you are interested in learning more, please contact me through my <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>  page.

          <h3>Data Analysis & Manuscript Editing</h3>
          <p> One of the most challenging aspects of a graduate student's journey is conducting data analysis and writing manuscripts with minimal support from their committee. Often, committee members are simply too busy, or they know what analyses should be conducted but offer no guidance on how to perform them in R.

            This is where I come in. I don't just provide the magical code; I offer comprehensive support throughout the data analysis stage. This often includes an annotated HTML report, ensuring you are fully informed about the analyses we have conducted and how to modify them.
            
            I also provide tailored support for manuscript writing, adapting to your specific needs. This can be through classes, collaborative editing, or other methods that suit you best.
            
            I charge $50 USD per hour for both services. Colombian nationals receive a discount! If you're interested, please write to me through my <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>  page.
